Everything on the site will be treated as a blog post. 

I imagine we can have a blog roll for KC, Epic, and Newsong in General. We could also add something for a Pastor's Blog or Family Newsletter (oh I really like the name of that!).

Here is what I'm thinking so far:

- `_posts` directory should be for general blog stuff.
- `_kc` would be Kingdom City
- `_epic` would be epic
- `_church` could be church wide information.
- `_people` will contain people profile pages. *I wasn't planning on this, but because Epic leaders wrote up bios and fun facts, we'll give it a shot*
