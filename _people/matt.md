#### About Me

I’ve been going to Newsong since the beginning of it all, but only started getting involved with ministry for the past couple of years. I have a career as a nurse in an Emergency Room at St. Joseph’s in Highland. I love being outdoors to hike, fish, golf, along with being lazy and watching Netflix and playing video games all day. The reason I got into student ministry is because I have a passion for kids and being a resource of encouragement, acceptance, and love for them. It is a blessing to be a part of their lives in this way and a privilege to be someone they trust for advice or just a listening ear on the struggles of life.
