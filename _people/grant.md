#### About Me

I was raised in a Christ-loving family to parents who always did their best to teach and show me the love of God. Coming to Newsong in seventh grade, I experienced how significant Church can be. Ever since middle school I would listen to Dave on Sunday mornings or speakers at youth camps and imagine myself doing what they did: preach. I don't think many seventh graders dream of that. In my life and faith, I have learned to ask questions, to lean into moments, to expect God, and to find joy in living in the tensions of faith. And now, as a pastor (we're doing it, seventh-grade me!), I am trying to learn the sacrament of listening over speaking. All the while, I'm trying to learn from and follow the revolutionary way of Jesus.

#### Fun Facts
- I _almost_ completed the milk chug challenge without throwing up
- I love space, stars, etc. and the science mumbo jumbo related to it.
- Theology, philosophy and religions are also really fascinating.
- I hate the feeling of lotion more than anything, but my hatred towards lavender scented Febreeze is a close second.
