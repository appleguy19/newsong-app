About me: I was raised in a Christ-loving family, and it seems like I've always known God. I've been in youth groups ever since I was first invited to one in the summer before 7th grade. When a senior in high school I couldn't wait to graduate so that I could be a small group leader and try to have the same influence that my small group leader had on me. 19th century philosopher Soren Kierkegaard once said, "Life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced." I think the same of faith. I'm passionate about Jesus, teaching students, asking questions and living out love. I live in love and try to live out that same love into the world.

Fun Facts: I almost completed the milk chug challenge without throwing up. I love space, stars, etc. and the science mumbo jumbo related to it. Theology, philosophy and religions are also really fascinating. Oh yeah, I'm also a big nerd. I hate the feeling of lotion more than anything, but my hatred towards lavender scented Fabreze is a close second.
