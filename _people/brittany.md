#### About Me

 I grew up in the VERY small town of Springerton, Illinois and attended church at the RLDS congregation in Springerton since birth and up until my freshman year of college. My great grandpa was and is in the priesthood there and I believe my core beliefs have been pretty strong my whole life. I was baptized at 8 years old and really began my relationship with God then.
 
 When I came to school at SIUE I would say I still believed but my relationship with God was very luke-warm until I found Newsong! When I started attending Imago (the college group) at Newsong is when I truly felt the Love of God through His people. Shelly Romoser and Lindsey Apple made such an impact on my life from the moment I met them. I continued attending Imago and eventually started going on Sundays.
 
 I have always had a passion for working with youth especially middle school and high school ages and have been a counselor at my church's youth camp since I was old enough to do so. When I was approached to lead Epic I knew right then it was what God wanted me to do. I continue to be open to God's plans and want to always show His love to those around me like I was shown and still am shown at Newsong everyday!
