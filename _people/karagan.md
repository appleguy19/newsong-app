#### About Me

Church has always been where I feel the most myself. Yet, my understanding of God was more of a misunderstanding for most my life. My faith was focused around fear; thus, it always felt forced and was not at all genuine.After my freshman year of high school I started re-forming my idea of God and realizing he LOVED me, right where I was. The fact that His love for me would NEVER change totally rocked my world.

My entire life I’ve deeply loved the simple act of helping those around me in any way I could; my favorite way is through encouragement. I never knew how that fit into God’s plan for me until I stumbled upon Social Work. Now I spend every day learning how to love people better and finding ways to provide help that leads to a better future for our world and everyone in it… living the dream right?!   I’m always changing, growing, and learning in my faith. Through it all, I know Christ is holding my hand; and if that’s the case, there’s nothing I can’t do. It’s a beautiful life!
