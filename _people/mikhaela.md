#### About Me

I have been serving the young women at epic since I graduated high school in 2013, and I must say that I have enjoyed every moment of it. I grew up in a Christian home, but my faith has grown and changed through experiences I have lived with others. Many of those experiences occurred during my time as either a student or leader in Epic Student Ministries. I am so thankful to Newsong Fellowship for the role it's played in my life, and I am passionate about contributing to the body of Newsong through Epic as a leader!
