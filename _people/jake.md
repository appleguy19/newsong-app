#### About Me

I grew up in the church and in a youth group. The friendships and relationships that came from my time in a youth group were some of the closest and most influential. I helped the Apple LifeGroup host a dinner for Epic weekend last year and felt a calling on a place where I could serve.  My interest lie in the outdoors. I enoy anything outside, from camping or hiking to just having a little bonfire with friends.

#### Fun Facts

- I'm a union welder
- Married my best friend on September 23, 2017
- Competed in high school rodeo
- I'm technologically illiterate
- I'm pretty sure I can eat more cheesecake than you
