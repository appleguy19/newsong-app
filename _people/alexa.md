#### About Me

  Hello! My name is Alexa Moss. I am 24 years old and am currently a graduate student at McKendree University. I have a passion for working with children, so I am studying to become a Special Education teacher. I currently am a teacher’s aide in a K-2nd grade Autism classroom. I not only get to learn about education as a whole, but I am able to express my compassion for the students every day.

  When I’m not working or attending school, I enjoy spending time with my loved ones, reading, participating in outdoor activities, and unwinding on Sunday and Thursday nights with my Newsong family. I have been attending Newsong for a little over 2 years now, and it’s amazing how quickly I have made so many relationships. I decided to become an Epic leader because I wanted to experience, together with my students, a beautiful journey on the path towards Christ.

#### Fun Facts

- I have one niece and 5 nephews, all over the age of 15
- I love photography and just recently photographed my second wedding
- I was born and raised Catholic
- I am getting married in June to another Epic leader, [Matt Huelsmann]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _people/matt.md %})
