#### About Me

I've been involved in Epic since I was in 6th grade. I have a huge passion for relationship and growing together with others through Christ. I have loved being able to grow with the other students and making some amazing friends along the way! I'm planning on majoring in theology and hoping to make it my profession some day. I've wanted to be a leader since I was a freshman in high school and now that I have the opportunity I couldn't be more grateful. Feel free to talk to me, I'm always open and ready to talk!

#### Fun Facts

- I love to draw and be creative
- I have a passion for anime and graphic design or anything to do with animation

- I'm the worst video game/ board game player in the world
