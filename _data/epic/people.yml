  bio: I have been serving the young women at epic since I graduated high school in 2013, and I must say that I have enjoyed every moment of it. I grew up in a Christian home, but my faith has grown and changed through experiences I have lived with others. Many of those experiences occurring during my time as either a student or leader in Epic Student Ministries. I am so thankful to Newsong Fellowship for the role it's played in my life, and I am passionate about contributing to the body of Newsong through Epic as a leader!

  role: Middle School Girls Leader
  bio: Church has always been where I feel the most myself. Yet, my understanding of God was more of a misunderstanding for most my life. My faith was focused around fear; thus, it always felt forced and was not at all genuine.  After my freshman year of high school I started re-forming my idea of God and realizing he LOVED me, right where I was. The fact that His love for me would NEVER change totally rocked my world.   My entire life I’ve deeply loved the simple act of helping those around me in any way I could; my favorite way is through encouragement. I never knew how that fit into God’s plan for me until I stumbled upon Social Work. Now I spend every day learning how to love people better and finding ways to provide help that leads to a better future for our world and everyone in it…living the dream right?!   I’m always changing, growing, and learning in my faith.  Through it all, I know Christ is holding my hand; and if that’s the case, there’s nothing I can’t do. It’s a beautiful life!
